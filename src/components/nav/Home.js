        This app lets anyone see the downwind events. You need to be logged in
        (Facebook or email) if you want to create/modify your event. You can
        then manage an event within:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a map{" "}
          <span>
            <Link to="/Map">
              <FaGlobe size={16} />
            </Link>
          </span>{" "}
          where you create and geolocate an event
        </li>
        <li>
          a list{" "}
          <span>
            <Link to="/cardlist">
              <FaAlignJustify size={16} />
            </Link>
          </span>{" "}
          where you can also create, but also remove an event, invite buddies,
          set a picture for the location and ask to participate.
        </li>
      </ul>{" "}
      <p>You may want to enable geolocalisation to center the map </p>
      <Geoloc />
      <br />
      <p>
        About the map:{" "}
        <span>
          <Link to="/Map">
            <FaGlobe size={16} />
          </Link>
        </span>
        . An event has a start point and an end point. You click on the map and
        assign 'start' on 'end' in the popup, and close the popup (x). You can
        also remove the marker. You can also use the search-box.
      </p>
      <p>Only the events created with the map will be geolocalized.</p>
      <p>
        About the list:{" "}
        <span>
          <Link to="/cardlist">
            <FaAlignJustify size={16} />
          </Link>
        </span>
        . You can delete your event there. You can select buddies and they will
        receive a mail. You can ask to participate to an event. When you click,
        the event owner will receive a mail. In this mail, the owner can click
        on the link to confirm your participation.
      </p>
