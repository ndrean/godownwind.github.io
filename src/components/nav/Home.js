        This app displays downwind events created by users. Once logged in with
        Facebook, you can ask the owner to participe, and you can create/modify
        your event. You can then manage an event using:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the map{" "}
          <span>
            <Link to="/Map">
              <FaGlobe size={16} />
            </Link>
          </span>{" "}
          . You visualize, create and geolocate an event with a start and end
          marker. Only the events created this way will be displayed on the map
          because you provide gps coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          a list{" "}
          <span>
            <Link to="/cardlist">
              <FaAlignJustify size={16} />
            </Link>
          </span>{" "}
          . You can also create an event but with no geolocation. However, with
          the list, you can invite buddies, set a picture and ask to
          participate.
        </li>
      </ul>{" "}
      <p>You may want to enable geolocation to center the map </p>
      <Geoloc />
      <br />
      <p>
        About the map:{" "}
        <span>
          <Link to="/Map">
            <FaGlobe size={16} />
          </Link>
        </span>
        . An event has a start point and an end point. You click on the map and
        assign 'start' on 'end' in the popup. To save, close the popup (x). You
        can also remove the marker.
      </p>
      <p>
        About the list:{" "}
        <span>
          <Link to="/cardlist">
            <FaAlignJustify size={16} />
          </Link>
        </span>
        . You can delete your event there. You can select buddies and they will
        receive a mail. You can ask to participate to an event. When you click,
        the event owner will receive a mail. In this mail, the owner can click
        on the link to confirm your participation.
      </p>
